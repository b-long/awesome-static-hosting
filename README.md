A collection of awesome static hosting providers, content management systems, and curated articles.

## Inspiration

Most importantly, this list wouldn't exist without the excellent work that's been done to create the [**Awesome Static Website Services**](https://github.com/aharris88/awesome-static-website-services) list.  Adam has curated some of the best resources, across a wide range, to help people develop their sites. 

We don't want to repeat that content, _go read the original!_
